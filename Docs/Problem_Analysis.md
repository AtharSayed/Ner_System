# Financial NER (Named Entity Recognition)

This project focuses on implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) for financial text to extract critical information from news articles, earnings reports, regulatory filings, and other financial documents. The goal is to identify and categorize important entities such as companies, financial figures, stock symbols, dates, and market events.

## Importance of NER in Financial Text

Named Entity Recognition plays a vital role in the financial sector by enabling the extraction of relevant information that helps in:

- **Market Analysis**: Track companies, stock performance, and financial metrics in real-time.
- **Risk Management**: Reduce the likelihood of mistakes by accurately identifying key financial entities.
- **Automation**: Facilitate automated trading and financial decision-making systems by providing structured data from unstructured sources.

## Key Challenges in Financial NER

- **Data Quality**: Ensuring that the data is clean, consistent, and well-structured.
- **Ambiguity**: Disambiguating entities that have multiple meanings (e.g., "Apple" as the fruit vs. the company).
- **Complex Terminology**: Recognizing financial jargon and domain-specific terms.
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieving high accuracy in recognizing entities to prevent costly financial mistakes.

## Scope of Entities to be Extracted

This NER system aims to extract the following key entities from financial texts:

1. **Companies & Organizations**
2. **Financial Figures (e.g., stock prices, earnings, market cap)**
3. **Stock Symbols**
4. **Dates & Time Periods**
5. **Events & Transactions (e.g., mergers, earnings reports)**
6. **Currency & Financial Products**
